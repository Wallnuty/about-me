                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>I'm trying to make a widget on my phone to control settings for my fan. There's already an app that does this but I want something that works straight from the homepage. To do this I have to use py-air-control and Wireshark to get communications between my fan and the internet unofficially, since ther's no official api for the fan's app. </p>
